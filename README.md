# Ni845x-Beamformer-Demo


Python Support for the NI-845x Devices

Currently, there isn't a Python library that can be used with 845X devices.

You can find a C API that can be used to program the device.
It may be possible to use the provided DLL in the same way you would call into any C based DLL from Python. 
This way of using the driver is not officially supported, meaning it has not been tested and full functionality is not guaranteed.
